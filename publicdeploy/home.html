  Hello! Welcome to version 2.0 of my website! Formerly known as <b>killkris</b>, I thought that name was a bit too edgy so I've renamed the place to <b>EVERYTHINGKRIS</b>!
  <p>I hope you enjoy your stay. I'll treat this homepage as a newspaper, and the other tabs up there will lead you to all the stuff that I find fun and awesome and epic.</p>
  <p>Feel free to write in my chat on the bottom left!:D I also have email: <a>killkris@protonmail.com</a> if you want to contact me. This is a paragraph! Here's how you make a link: <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>. Here's how you can make <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.
    <p>Im totally into just creating stuff in general :D it's what we were made for. I love space and the stars cuz they're amazing ... other stuff I like making are zines, posters, designs, and pages in my junk journal! i still haven't implemented a junk journal page lol... that's on me! but in the meantime u can check out the Rabbit holes page, which has stuff that interest me all over the internet :)</p>
