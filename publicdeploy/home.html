      <p>Clarice Starling has got to be THE best Final Girl (change my mind)!</p>
      <p>The matter of her being a woman is pivotal to the story, and yet never cliche. She's scrappy "white trash" and that makes her journey in the FBI all the more compelling. Men leer, they tower over her, and her reaction is akin to that of most women’s: to bite her tongue and act like nothing’s happening; even though, the disrespect is palpable. The only time she ever mentions it is during the drive back from West Virginia, to her boss, whom she at least has a good rapport. And the way she talks about it isn’t dramatic; she just tells him a fact:</p>
      <div class="blockquote"><i>"It matters, Mr. Crawford. Cops look to you to see how to act. It matters.”</i></div>
      <p>Her assignment to speak with Lecter is even based on her being a woman — perhaps she’ll stir something in the man, what with him not having seen one for years.</p>
      <p>I can’t speak on Hannibal’s thought process. Hell, even the author, Thomas Harris, narrates him like a mere witness. Which makes sense, given his previous career as a journalist. It’s fascinating, really, because in (rare) interviews, he describes it more as a “passive process,” wherein the scenes just play out. He doesn’t make anything up. It happens, unfolds in front of him.</p>
      <p>And it’s quite beautiful, how protective Harris is of Starling. I notice that there are often female characters in his novels that you can’t help but feel protective of, and the rest of the characters seem to agree. In Red Dragon (2002), Reba inherently does need help. She’s blind. But again, she’s capable, and can hold her own even in the final act when Dolarhyde abandons her in the most horrifying situation possible. Hannibal even had a sister, whose gruesome end began his penchant for cannibalism.</p>
      <p>In Silence of the Lambs, it is of course, our darling Clarice.</p>
      <p>She is not a strong female character. She is a strong character, period. I love her. Hannibal would not have been nearly as fascinating without her to have a back-and-forth with. What makes her more endearing is her sheer sincerity: she never lies to Lecter, but she can go toe-to-toe with him — certainly, she is not nearly as refined as him, but her tenacity and hard-earned skills from F.B.I. training make her formidable.</p>
      <p>I’m not quite sure where I’d read it, but one of the most compelling theories I saw as to why Hannibal was so captivated by her was because she let him practice his profession. The hurdle of being incarcerated does make it hard to do any sort of psychiatry. I digress. She answered his questions but she shot her own right back; she made her own guesses, poked and prodded just as he would; pressed no matter how unnerving the man was.</p>
      <p>I guess, in a sense, I aspire to be like her. Scrappy with a little taste, smart in the way it matters. I love you, Clarice Starling!</p>

      <p>Happy Halloween , interwebs!</p>
      <p>I'm (unfortunately?) a huge homebody and don't want to go to any parties. I'm past my freshman year - no more dirtbag nights out lol. I might recount some stories on here sometime!</p>
      <p>But I freaking love Halloween... the dressing up! An excuse for everyone to just put on their weirdest, silliest, scariest garb! I'd like to enumerate some of my costumes, past and dream.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Sims character</b></p>
          <p>My sister and I wore matching Sims costumes here, we basically had the same outfit on BUT had differently colored plumbobs (that's the diamond thing on top of Sims' heads) and whoever was wearing the orange plumbob at the time had to act cranky LOL. We made the plumbob headbands ourselves! I wish I had a pic; I mean, I know I do but it's too far deep in the asscrack of my gallery app.</li>
        <li><p><b>Max from the Goofy Movie</b></p>
          <p>I wore this to a Halloween party in my sophomore year! I had the black long sleeves, super baggy red tee, baggy pants, backwards red cap, and of course my nose was painted black! I straightened my hair a bit so it'd look like Max's ears, too. lol. Honestly such a chic costume!!! It got hot toward the end of the night and I had to take off the baggy tee so I was just serving random first-stage anthrophomorpization (furry moding) instead of Goofy Movie Max.</li>
        <li><p><b>Paddington Bear</b></p>
          <p>OMFG. Paddington is seriously my favourite little guy in the WORLD (next to my dog Peanut). I wanted to dress as him this year but the costume would be wayyy too hot. Coat, hat, yeah I couldn't handle that in my area's climate. BUT OMFG I LOVE PADDINGTON SOOO MUCH it would be my dream to dress up as him. Such a cute little guy.</p><p>Odd realization: I'd have to paint my nose black for this one too. Not sure if I like where my costume preferences are going... /j</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I know it's totally lame I don't have any pics up but if I get the time, I'll post them on a diff tab here! For your viewing pleasure lol. I hope other people post some Halloween stuff on their websites too! :)</p>
      <p>Tonight, my Halloween plans are probably just watching some movies - hopefully with my sis and mom!!!</p>

      <p>All the music tech we've got today is so freaking awesome. First and foremost: piracy my beloved!</p>
      <p>Downloading tracks directly onto your PC is a lost art. Youtube to MP3, then you sort them all into a file and get some pictures for the album cover, then fill out the info since you're pretty much just listening to a Youtube video. Then, depending how old you were at the time, burn it onto a CD! And put together a CD collection!</p>
      <p>Now, I don't have much analog stuff to be honest. I'm definitely a Spotify addict. But I'm trying to recover! I've never fiddled with Last.FM or the Scrobble stuff, but I see it around a lot. Maybe when I have some free time, I'll get into a little rabbit hole with that.</p>
      <p>I digress!</p>
      <p>Rock out, girl - you gotta own your music again! Subscription is not ownership. So, how do we do that, aside from the classic Yt->Mp3->Cd method? (I'm asking, too! Researching as I write this!)</p> 
      <p><b>Bandcamp!</b></p>
      <p>This actually lets you support your fav artists directly. Yeah, if you didn't already know, Spotify barely pays its artists. Scumbags! And you can download FLAC - or, <i>free lossless audio quality!</i></p>
      <p>Spotify doesn't offer FLAC. It's not lossless. Basically, I'm sure neither you nor I have mostly noticed that, but to be charging us a monthly rate and we can't even directly download? What a bunch of crap. If I'm not careful, this article'll devolve into Fuck Spotify really fast.</p>
      <p>I'm not gonna lie, so far, Bandcamp seems like the best alternative. I personally hate the concept of subscriptions - anything that isn't a single payment upfront irks me. So personally, Bandcamp looks great.</p>
      <p>But if we're still on the topic of Spotify substitutes (subscription based), take a look at:</p>
      <p><b>Tidal!</b></p>
      <p>This looks more worth-it if you're a big audiophile and REALLY like high-quality music. And you have the proper equipment to really get the whole experience. Speakers, headphones, stuff like that. They pay their artists more than Spotify, too (or so I've heard).</p>
      <p>Anyway, just some tidbits while I listen to my musics.</p>

      <p>Hello! Welcome to version 2.0 of my website! Formerly known as <b>killkris</b>, I thought that name was a bit too edgy so I've renamed the place to <b>EVERYTHINGKRIS</b>!</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy your stay. I'll treat this homepage as a newspaper, and the other tabs up there will lead you to all the stuff that I find fun and awesome and epic.</p>
      <p>Feel free to write in my chat on the bottom left!:D I also have email: <a>killkris@protonmail.com</a> if you want to contact me. This is a paragraph! Here's how you make a link: <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>. Here's how you can make <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.
      <p>Im totally into just creating stuff in general :D it's what we were made for. I love space and the stars cuz they're amazing ... other stuff I like making are zines, posters, designs, and pages in my junk journal! i still haven't implemented a junk journal page lol... that's on me! but in the meantime u can check out the Rabbit holes page, which has stuff that interest me all over the internet :)</p>
