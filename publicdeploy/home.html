    Hi! As you can see I've got some old web ads here, including my own on the bottom!. I love them! But I'd like to have Nice ads... ones that lead to my fellow neocities users! So anybody who comes across this... 
    <p><b>Come advertise on my website!</b></p>
    <p>It can be a square or banner, just not a skyscraper type.</p>
    <p>there are NO requirements by the way! this is just for fun. I mean, definitely email me with: an image (no style requirement!) and link me back to your site. But that's pretty much it!</p>
    <p><b>Edit:</b>I've discovered BannerLink!!!still though, I want square ads for the right side so still feel free to send some!!! :D</p>

      Hello! Welcome to version 2.0 of my website! Formerly known as <b>killkris</b>, I thought that name was a bit too edgy so I've renamed the place to <b>EVERYTHINGKRIS</b>!
      <p>I hope you enjoy your stay. I'll treat this homepage as a newspaper, and the other tabs up there will lead you to all the stuff that I find fun and awesome and epic.</p>
      <p>Feel free to write in my chat on the bottom left!:D I also have email: <a>killkris@protonmail.com</a> if you want to contact me. This is a paragraph! Here's how you make a link: <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>. Here's how you can make <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.
      <p>Im totally into just creating stuff in general :D it's what we were made for. I love space and the stars cuz they're amazing ... other stuff I like making are zines, posters, designs, and pages in my junk journal! i still haven't implemented a junk journal page lol... that's on me! but in the meantime u can check out the Rabbit holes page, which has stuff that interest me all over the internet :)</p>
