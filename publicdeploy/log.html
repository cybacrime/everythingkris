        <div class="heading">Raoul must've thought Christine was a basket case at first<span class="date">11/12/25</span></div>
        <p>Okay, around the start of Phantom of the Opera, Raoul goes to talk to Christine, right? Like he's congratulating her on getting the lead, talking about how she's been visited by the Angel of Music. Alright, cool, yeah good job Christine. He literally says no doubt about it! Yep Angel of Music. But the Angel of Music is just like, a concept to him. It's not some guy.</p>
        <p>So I'm thinking, he must've been a little weirded out when Christine said "the Angel of Music is very strict!" and "Things have changed, Raoul." Like, what do you mean it's strict? "It" doesn't exist ... Do you just have a training regimen for yourself? Like damn Christine you must be locked in cause to him, she just looks crazy dedicated to her art. Emphasis on crazy.</p>
        <p>I think now's a good time to mention I'm a huge Phantom of the Opera fan.</p>

        <p>The worst thing about having a lot of ideas is wondering which one to go with! I'm going to keep redesigning this Log page's styling, until it feels RIGHT!</p>
        <p>What a great problem to have, huh?</p>

        <div class="heading">I miss my mom <span class="date">30/10/25</span></div>
        <p>I'm so freaking stupid... my mom booked an amazing villa for the weekend and we ALWAYS go on vacation, so I was somehow a little vacation-fatigued. So I said I'd stay behind. I was catching up on some work so I thought it was logical.</p>
        <p>But that was the worst decision ever!!! I don't care about the villa part, I just want to be around my mom and sister! I'm so sad. I miss them so much, even though it's only been a few hours. I wish I went!... it's so lonely in the house.</p>
        <p>I MISS MY MOM!!!!!</p>

        <p>All my old logs were a bit blue... and I feel much better now. I took out what didn't make me happy and here we are! Big redesign and more fun!!! I really love working on my websites, and I feel like I've gotten so much better + smarter since I've last updated! I'm so proud of how far I've come!</p>

        <div class="heading">When I fall, I get back up :) <span class="date">6/9/24</span></div>
        <p>I think 90% of the time I'm pretty well adjusted , but I think most of us can never get rid of that 10%. When I fall into that 10% it's fine, because I can always get better and I can always be happy and play with my dog and love those around me. Life does not matter all that much, and I'd like to spend most of it loving my dog, and just having fun. It is inevitable that I will get worse again but let this log be proof that it can get better and I can be happy again. Every day there is a new opportunity to be happy. I love you Peanut.

        <div class="heading">Making a zine library website<span class="date">14/8/24</span></div>
        <p>Hey guys!! I've been super into zines lately and I've been designing a new website to start a digital zine collection ... Like a library!! Haha it's so fun to learn web design it's kind of painful but really pays off once stuff starts working and stuff starts looking good. I've always wanted to work in print and advertising so zines really interest me! I hope I can share it here soon because I'm just working on it in VSCode right now... :D</p>
