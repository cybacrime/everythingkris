            <p>D-Man's <b>Old Net Stories</b> is some awesome sleuthing! He writes all about some rabbit holes he goes into, and I've got to recommend you check out Episode #4, The Magic Balloon.</p>
            <p>You can join in and help discover some stuff too! Aside from that, D-Man's site is chock full of fascinating/relatable writings. Check him out!</p>

            <p>RetroMaster94's website is SO Frutiger Metro, so 2000s, and inspired me to redesign my website layout. And they have amazing motion & logo designs, I thought they were fully real! Past sense "thought" because I saw a radio station logo redesign in my local area and realized it wasn't the same. But for a moment I truly thought, hell yeah that new redesign is cool!</p>
            <p>Very professional and yet ...so full of personality !!</p>

            ALIENGARDEN's layout is so metal. I love the little game in the Journal tab!

            Another webmaster that inspired me to redesign my site. Henry's command of color is so fun, and there's actually so many pages to explore. This is true old web!

        <div class="neighbor_container_content">
            Humanfinny is another totally Frutiger website! The site is based on an actual old Japanese site if I recall correctly, so it's no surprise this feels so classic. There's a lot of tabs to explore for yourself! Check them out!

            <p>N introduces a lot of their pages with a narrative which is fun and gets you in the exact mood they want you while you surf their directory.</p>
            <p>I've just started reading Anna Karenina and saw their review, and I'm definitely more curious as to how the book turns out after reading N's little blurb about it!</p>
            <p>Make sure to peek in their Blog tab in the directory :)</p>

            <p>Avi's website is like nothing I've seen before! Their layout is amazing and there's no doubt they know their way around a freakin computer! Play some of her music on her playlist on the left while perusing the album review she has up. Awesome!</p>
